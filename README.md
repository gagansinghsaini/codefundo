It is a deep learning network to make prediction about Tornadoes with added functionalty of red alert in any natural disaster through in an android app. We will use satellite images of specific area over intervals of time and train the network to extrapolate the images of future on the basis of certain input data which either user can provide or take from other source provided in the app. We will also add the functionality to infrom people of other natural disasters on the basis of govt. issued red alert according to their location. we will also add the safety measures to take in any natural disaster.

After the disaster has occured our android application will share instant messages using wifi direct automatically to everyone having that application. It's basic functioning principle is that if someone types a message in the application then anyone with the application within the range(of wifi direct that is 200 metres) will the recieve the help message. The message would then automatically be sent to everyone connected with this person and thus a chain reaction will start. Once the help or rescue is made then the person who asked for the rescue will delete the message and it will automatically get removed from each person's phone once the connection is made. This technology is helpful as no internet and phone connection will be available. The app has an offline map saved. The app contains your feeds for easy browse and check for any response to your help.
