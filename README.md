We plan to develop an android application which will share instant messages using wifi direct automatically to everyone having that application.
It's basic functioning principle is that if someone types a message in the application then anyone with the application within the range(of 
wifi direct that is 200 metres) will the recieve the help message. The message would then automatically be sent to everyone connected with this person 
and thus a chain reaction will start. 
Once the help or rescue is made then the person who asked for the rescue will delete the message and it will automatically get removed from each 
person's phone once the connection is made. This technology is helpful as no internet and phone connection will be available.  
The app has an offline map saved.
The app contains your feeds for easy browse and check for any response to your help.
